                    <h2>'I'm training with the world's best set of defenders - it's great for me'</h2>
                    <h3>
                        Rhys Williams will strive to absorb as much as possible from a pool of defenders he considers
                        the world's best during Liverpool's pre-season training camp.
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The young centre-back was joined by Joe Gomez, Joel Matip and Virgil van Dijk in the first team
                        session of the stay in Austria on Tuesday morning, as that trio returned to group work following
                        their respective long-term injuries.
                        <br><br>
                        New signing Ibrahima Konate was also present – and Williams has detailed his determination to
                        learn plenty as he looks to build on a 2020-21 campaign during which he made 19 first-team
                        appearances for the Reds.
                        <br><br>
                        “To try to replicate last season if I can,” the 20-year-old told Liverpoolfc.com at the team
                        hotel, when asked about his targets for 2021-22.
                        <br><br>
                        “Maybe sneak a few more games in, but it’s going to be hard [because] we’ve got the three back
                        who have been injured last season. But even if I can learn off them, that sets me in good stead
                        for a few seasons down the line.
                        <br><br>
                        “I’m training with the best set of defenders in the world in my opinion, and the best defender
                        in the world in Virg. Any time I get with them is a gain.
                        <br><br>
                        “It’s massive [to have Gomez, Matip and Van Dijk back in training]. We had major issues last
                        season at centre-back, which obviously led to me coming in and doing the best I could. But
                        seeing them come back – they’re all big characters amongst the boys so having them back is a
                        massive boost for the team.
                        <br><br>
                        “I’m the second-youngest there, there’s only Billy [Koumetio] younger than me, so anything that
                        I can pick up off them… they’ve had a lot of experience, played a lot of games, so anything I
                        can take from his [Konate’s] game, from Joe, Joel, Virg, is a boost for me.”
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Rhys, you’ve done your first team training session of the Austria pre-season camp – how was it?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Well, it was harder than usual, I think you can imagine! But everyone’s looking good, everyone’s
                        looking sharp, so we’re just trying to build our fitness up now and hopefully get into what’s
                        going to be a special season.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        After the lactate tests on Monday, it must have been nice to be back out there with the team,
                        working with the ball again?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Yeah, I didn’t expect to see the balls out so soon – I was expecting a few more running
                        sessions! But no, after the lactate sessions I think getting the balls out again was a good
                        motivator for the boys.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        As an individual, what are your aims for this training camp?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        To come out of it the best I can be. I mean, if I can gain one or two per cent, that’s going to
                        be massive for me over the course of the season because I’m chasing the players ahead of me. So
                        that’s my goal.
                    </p>
